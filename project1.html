		<h2>A place I would like to visit.</h2>
		
	<p> If I could visit anywhere in the world I would visit Hawaii. I want  to visit Hawaii because of the beautiful scenery and a good place to hang out and relax beside the beautiful beaches. Another reason I would like to visit Hawaii is that they have 8 islands so I thought it would be cool to visit all 8.</p>
